This project implements a disk-based cache. The client library was provided as 
part of the project. A caching proxy and the server has been written to complete
the project. The client connects to the proxy and the proxy connects to the server.

The proxy will handle the RPC file operations from the client interposition library. 
It will fetch whole files from the server, and cache them locally. The protocol used
between the proxy and the server, and cache management has been self-defined. 
The protocol is not implemented at the level of individual file operations. Rather, 
it operates at a higher level on whole files and cover cache management operations.

See handout.pdf for additional details.
A brief design document is given in the src folder
